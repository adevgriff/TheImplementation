This is my suny polytechnic institue BS degree capstone.

Goal to emulate the xtensa lx106 processor that is part of the esp8266 microcontroller/wifi chip primarily using the XTENSA ISA

This should altimately end in a header only library that allows a user to create an instance of the processor and interact with that instance.
